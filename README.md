# Project Statement:

In a real estate environment, it can be easy to overlook the significance of a project manager’s role: to keep the project moving on schedule and under budget. In the past, some project managers had to justify their presence on a project site. But today, project managers’ pay structure — and the incentives for projects wrapping up as planned — indicates that their value has proven itself over time. 
 
# Project Description:

Real estate is considered real property that includes land and anything permanently attached to it or built on it, whether natural or man-made. There are five main categories of real estate which include residential, commercial, industrial, raw land, and special use. Investing in real estate includes purchasing a home, rental property, or land. Indirect investment in real estate can be made via REITs or through pooled real estate investment.
